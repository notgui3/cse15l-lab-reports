When using cd with no arguments, it sends the user back to the home directory. This is shown when I was in /home/lecture1, and when I used cd, the directory was back at /home. <br>
When using cd with a folder as an argument, it sends the user into the file and updates the working directory to that file. This is shown when I used cd lecture1 at /home, and my new directory was /home/lecture1. <br>
When using cd with a file as an argument, it spits out an error. This is shown when I tried to cd into the javaTester file from /home, and it said that javaTester was not a directory. <br>

When using ls with no arguments, it shows the files and folders that your current working directory has. This is shown when I used ls at /home, and it showed all the files and folders in /home. <br>
When using ls with a folder as an argument, it shows the files and folders that the specified folder has within it. This is shown when I used ls lecture1, and it showed me all the files in lecture1 and not at /home. <br>
When using ls with a file as an argument, it repeats the name of the file. This is shown when I used ls javaTester, and it outputted "javaTester". <br>

When using cat with no arguments, it allows you to type things and it repeats them back until you terminate or quit out of it. This is shown when I used just cat and typed lab1, it outputted "lab1", and I quit using ctrl + c. <br>
When using cat with a folder as an argument, it spits out an error saying that the folder is a directory. This is shown when I tried to type cat lecture1, and it just said that lecture1 was a directory. <br>
when using cat with a file as an argument, it outputs the contents of the file. This is shown when I tried to cat lab1, and it outputted its git clone contents. <br>
